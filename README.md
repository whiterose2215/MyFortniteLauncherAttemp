# Fornite Launcher Please read
I'm 100% okay with anyone using it, it's cool! Just credit Me @vtable AND credit anyone else like ur defo using reload if your using this so credit burlone and stuff, credits are really important!
Anyways, if you use it without my credits I will find your proejct and shut it down, I'm not mean, I try to be nice <3        
If someone is using this without my credits find me on discord, my user is krabb_patty

Enjoy!



Bug note: I found out that trying to go back to home screen is currently bugged, thankfully when you go to settings and click save your info does save you just have to reset the launcher, this will be fixed in the 1.0.1 Update that should be out like next week or so. Also my bday is tmr at the time of 3/6/25 :)
